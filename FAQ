## Database schema ##
#####################

* After some time I've noticed entries like this one in my from_awl;
-undef- | -undef- | aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd | xxxx-xx-xx xx:xx:xx.xxxxxx

This is expected. Mail servers send you e-mail notices when they can't
deliver your messages. When doing so, the Return-Path is empty.
As at least MySQL doesn't support NULL in PRIMARY KEYs, SQLgrey creates
these '-undef- | -undef-' entries to recognise these cases.

* Why isn't there any PRIMARY KEY or INDEX on the connect table ?
* Why isn't there an INDEX on the column <xxx> ?

I usually add a PRIMARY KEY to each table where there's a (KEY, VALUE)
structure. It's rarely bad for performance and help detect bugs in
the way the application layer handles the data.
Unfortunately MySQL doesn't support PRIMARY KEYs on columns
whose aggregate size is more than 500 bytes :
ERROR 1071: Specified key was too long. Max key length is 500

When adding support to PostgreSQL I could have added a PostgreSQL
specific PRIMARY KEY. I chose not to because I was not convinced it
was a good idea to introduce different database schema depending on
the actual database system.

More importantly, it may very well be that simple indexes on some columns
might be sufficient and will be supported by every database.

If you want to help on this and have at least a moderate-trafic MTA
(more than 5000 messages/day), please send me (lionel-dev@bouton.name) :

- the result of "SELECT count(*) FROM connect",
- the mean execution time of 
	SELECT count(*) FROM connect
	WHERE  first_seen < NOW() - INTERVAL '24 HOUR'
 (for MySQL remove the single-quotes from '24 HOUR')
  with and without indexes (please give the INDEX creation syntax)
- the mean execution time of
	SELECT 1 FROM connect
	WHERE sender_name = <val> AND sender_domain = <val>
	AND ip_addr = <val> AND rcpt = <val> AND
	first_seen BETWEEN now() - INTERVAL '24  HOUR' AND
	now() - INTERVAL '6 MINUTE'
  with and without indexes (please give the INDEX creation syntax)
