* After some time I've noticed entries like this one in my from_awl;
-undef- | -undef- | aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd | xxxx-xx-xx xx:xx:xx.xxxxxx

This is expected. Mail servers send you e-mail notices when they can't deliver
your messages. When doing so, the Return-Path is empty.
As at least MySQL doesn't support NULL in PRIMARY KEYs, SQLgrey creates these
'-undef- | -undef-' entries to recognise these cases.
