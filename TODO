1.4.4
- more support for VERP style return-paths
- tune for SRS (SES and BATV too ?)
- send mails (adjustable rate) to postmaster when the database goes down and comes back

1.4.x
- uniform ip_addr column name,
  add index on ip_addr in connect table
  and add first_seen in from_awl and domain_awl
  (up the database version to 2)
- bug with multiple connect entries matching a reconnection (only in multiple
  SQLgrey instances configs) to fix
- create a stress-testing suite (for performance/reliability tests)
- make SQLgrey return value configurable
  
1.5.x
- use time units everywhere to make configuration easier
- experiment with SPF support
- switch from log level to log categories
- external cleanup process/experiment with an adaptative cleanup algorithm
- check if permission related SQL errors are catchable
- try to exit with a proper error code when database is unavailable or the user doesn't
  have enough rights to access the pid-file
- consider optin/optout (is it easy to do with Postfix? Then provide an HOWTO
  else code it in SQLgrey)
- support migrating from another greylister by calling it to learn its auto-whitelists

As soon as available...
- gather enough perf data to decide on indices to add
