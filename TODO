1.4.3
- put back output to stdout
- allow distributing whitelists from a central point
 . reload whitelists on SIGUSR1 (done)
 . separate script which updates the whitelist and calls SIGUSR1

1.4.x
- bug with multiple connect entries matching a reconnection (only in multiple
  SQLgrey instances configs) to fix
- send mails (adjustable rate) to postmaster when the database goes down and comes back
- create a stress-testing suite (for performance/reliability tests)
- add index on ip_addr in connect table (up the database version to 2)
- make SQLgrey return value configurable
  
1.5.x
- use time units everywhere to make configuration easier
- experiment with SPF support
- switch from log level to log categories
- external cleanup process/experiment with an adaptative cleanup algorithm
- check if permission related SQL errors are catchable
- try to exit with a proper error code when database is unavailable or the user doesn't
  have enough rights to access the pid-file
- consider optin/optout (is it easy to do with Postfix? Then provide an HOWTO
  else code it in SQLgrey)
- support migrating from another greylister by calling it to learn its auto-whitelists

As soon as available...
- gather enough perf data to decide on indices to add
