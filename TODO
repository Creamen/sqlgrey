1.4.x
- allow distributing whitelists from a central point
 . reload whitelists on SIGUSR1
 . separate script which updates the whitelist and calls SIGUSR1
- send mails (adjustable rate) to postmaster when the database goes down and comes back
- make maint_delay configurable

1.5.x
- use time units everywhere to make configuration easier
- experiment with SPF support
- consider optin/optout (is it easy to do with Postfix? Then provide an HOWTO
  else code it in SQLgrey)
- support migrating from another greylister by calling it to learn its auto-whitelists
